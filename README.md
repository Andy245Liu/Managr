# Managr

Managr is a Java-based time management and scheduling desktop app for students using JCalendar and an SQLite database. Students can add and keep track of their assignments, homework, projects, course culminatings, tests, quizzes, and exams. They can sort them by due date, priority (i.e., how much an event is weighted for marks/important to the student) and view them on a calendar user interface. They can also plan study sessions using the calendar, as well as view their events on each day.
*Note in order to use Managr, you must have jdbc sqlite installed (you'll need a sqlite-jdbc-3.30.1.jar file) and JCalendar installed (you'll need a jcalendar-1.4.jar file). 

*Also, in the Main.java file, you must change the URL variable to "jdbc:sqlite:PATH TO YOUR ManagrData.db file" (example: public static final String URL = "jdbc:sqlite:D:/Managr/Managr3/ManagrData.db").
